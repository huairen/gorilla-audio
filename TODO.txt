ROAD MAP
---

TODO:
- Add support for mono/8-bit mixer formats
- Apply volatile keyword to values that are set/checked in non-mutexed multi-threaded code
- Preserve sound data when a sound is destroyed while it is still in-use by a handle
  - Defer the actual cleanup in ga_sound_destroy()
  - When last handle actively using the sound is dead, actually clean out the data
  - If the sound does not own the data, either assert or make a copy of the data
- Mixer-side enveloping
- Multi-stream-synchronization
- Handle-locking for atomic groups of control commands
- Implement OpenSL (Android 2.3+) device
- Port to Linux and Mac

BACKLOG:
- Improve extensibility of GAU file loading/streaming
- Rename GA_FILE_FORMAT* to GAU_FILE_FORMAT* as needed
- Improve user-based device extensibility
- Improve error-handling
- Implement OpenMAX AL device
- Implement DirectSound device
- Doxygen API documentation

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Crashes when attempting to use a non-power-of-two mixer size
- Crashes when destroying a ga_Sound while the mixer is mixing it
